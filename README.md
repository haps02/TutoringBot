# üß† TutoringBot ‚Äì Multi-Agent AI Tutoring System

This is a full-stack multi-agent AI tutoring system built with a React frontend (`TutoringBot-fe`) and a Python backend (`TutoringBot-be`). The system intelligently delegates user queries to specialized tutoring agents via a Root Agent, making learning interactive and personalized.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Architecture Overview

The system is built using Google's **Gemini API** and the **ADK (Agent Development Kit)** framework to support modular, multi-agent behavior.

### üß© Agents

- **Root Agent**: Receives all user queries and routes them to the appropriate tutor agent.
- **Greeting Agent**: Handles greetings and onboarding.
- **Farewell Agent**: Handles conversation endings and polite exits.
- **Math Tutor Agent**: Handles mathematics-related queries.
- **Physics Tutor Agent**: Handles physics-related queries.
- **Biology Tutor Agent**: Handles biology-related queries.

### üõ† Tools Used

- **Calculator Tool**: Performs dynamic mathematical calculations.
- **Lookup Table Tool**: Retrieves subject-specific facts or concepts.
- **Load Memory Tool**: Adds contextual memory across interactions.
